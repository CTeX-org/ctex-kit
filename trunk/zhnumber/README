------------

zhnumber is a package which provides 'expandable' commands to typeset Chinese
representations of numbers. This package depends on CJK or xeCJK package. 
It seems that zhnumber is a good alternative to CJKnumb package.


This package is licensed under LPPL.


Basic Usage
-----------

The package provides the following macros:

  \zhnumber{number}
    Convert `number' to a full Chinese representation.

  \zhnum{counter}
    Similar to \arabic{counter}, but representation of 'counter' as Chinese numerals.

  \zhdigits{number}
  \zhdigits*{number}
    Handle `number' as a string of digits and convert each of them into the
    corresponding Chinese digit. The starred version uses the traditional glyph
    for digit zero; the unstarred version uses the Chinese circle glyph.
