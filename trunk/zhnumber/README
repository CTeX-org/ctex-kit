Introduction
------------
The zhnumber package provides commands to typeset Chinese representations of
numbers. This package depends on CJK or xeCJK package. The difference between
this package and 'CJKnumb' is that commands provided by this package is
expandable. So, it seems that zhnumber is a good alternative to CJKnumb package.

Basic Usage
-----------
The package provides the following macros:

  \zhnumber{number}
    Convert `number' to a full Chinese representation.

  \zhnum{counter}
    Similar to \arabic{counter}, but representation of 'counter' as Chinese numerals.

  \zhdigits{number}
  \zhdigits*{number}
    Handle `number' as a string of digits and convert each of them into the
    corresponding Chinese digit. The starred version uses the traditional glyph
    for digit zero; the unstarred version uses the Chinese circle glyph.
