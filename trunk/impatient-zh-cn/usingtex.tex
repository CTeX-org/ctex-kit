\section 從鍵盘輸入變到油墨

\subsection 你所需要的程序和文件

為了製作一個 \TeX\ 文檔, 你必需運行 \TeX\ 及其相關軟件.
你同時也需要一些 \TeX\ 及其相關軟件所用到的輔助文件.
在這本書中, 我們僅僅談論 \TeX\ 和一些通用的軟件及輔助文件,
不過我們不會介紹其它的, 因為它們僅僅和你自己的 \TeX\ 環境相關.
為你提供 \TeX\ 的人可以為你提供我們所說的\emph{本地信息}.
\pix^^{local information}
這些本地信息可以告訴你如何去啓動 \TeX, 如何去使用相關的程序,
以及如何去訪問這些所用到的輔助文件.


你可以使用一個 ^{文本編輯器} 來編寫一個可以輸入到 \TeX\ 的普通文本文件.
一個 \TeX\ 輸入文件和一個文字處理軟件的輸入文件不同, 它通常並不存在任何不可見的^{控製字符}.
任何 \TeX\ 讀到的字符對你來說, 都是你可以看到的.

你的輸入文件, 可以僅僅是一個引用其它輸入文件的框架.
\TeX\ 用戶往往把大的文檔, 比如說這本書, 組織成這種形式.
你可以使用 ^|\input| 命令 (\xref\input) 來把一個輸入文件篏入到另一個中.
特別地, 你可以使用 |\input|來調入包含\emph{宏定義}的文件,
^^{macros//in auxiliary files}
宏定義是一些輔助的定義, 它可以來增強 \TeX\ 的功能.
如果你的 \TeX\ 系統中包含任何的宏文件, 
和 \TeX\ 相關的本地信息會告訴你如何得到這些宏文件, 
以及它們的功能.
\TeX\ 的標準安裝形式, 也就是在這本書中所描述的, 包括了一個被稱為 ^{\plainTeX} (\xref{\plainTeX}) 的宏集.

當 \TeX\ 處理你的文檔時, 它會產生一種叫做  ^{\dvifile} 的文件. 
其中, ``|dvi|'' 的全稱為 ``device independent (設備無關)''.
之所以選用這個縮寫, 是因為 \dvifile\ 中所包含的信息和你的打印或顯示設備無關.


當你需要打印或使用\emph{閱覽器}查看你的文檔時, ^^{previewer}
你需要使用相應的\emph{設備驅動}來處理之. ^^{device drivers}
(閱覽器是一個程序, 它能把和打印出來的結果差不多的排版內容顯示在屏幕上.)
不同的輸出設備往往需要不同的設備驅動. 在運行設備驅動以後,
你還需要把設備驅動輸出的內容傳輸到打印機或者其它輸出設備上.
^^{printers} ^^{output devices}  
和 \TeX\ 相關的本地信息會告訴你如何得到正確的設備驅動和如何使用它.

因為 \TeX\ 內部並沒有任何關於一個特定字體的任何信息, 
它使用\emph{字體文件}
^^{font files}
來得到你文檔中所使用的字體的信息.
字體文件也是你本地 \TeX\ 環境的一個組成部分.
一個字體一般對應兩個文件:
一個文件 (\emph{字體信息文件}) ^^{metrics file} 包括了字體中每個字符的大小信息,
另一個文件 (\emph{字體輪廓文件}) ^^{shape file} 則描述了字體中字符的形狀.
一個字體的縮放版本使用同樣的字體信息文件, 不過並不使用相同的字體輪廓文件.
^^{magnification}
字體信息文件往往用來指稱 ^{\tfmfile}, 
而字體輪廓文件則往往用來指稱 ^{\pkfile}, ^{\pxlfile} 和 ^{\gffile} 等不同的種類.
這些名稱和 \TeX\ 以及相關軟件所使用的文件的文件名所對應.
比如, |cmr10.tfm| 為 |cmr10| 字體的字體信息文件 (10-點的計算機現代字體).

\TeX\ 本身僅使用字體信息文件, 因為它只關心這個字體的字符占用了多大的空間, 
而並不關心這個字體的外形是什麼樣子的.
設備驅動則往往需要使用字體輪廓文件,
因為它需要負責把每個排出的字符變成印出的圖形.
某些設備驅動也需要使用字體信息文件.
一些設備驅動可以使用打印機中包含的字體, 
所以可以不需要這些字體的字體輪廓文件.

\subsection 運行 {\TeX}

\bix^^{running \TeX}

你可以通過輸入類似 `|run tex|' 或 `|tex|' (查看你的本地信息) 來運行 \TeX\ 來處理一個輸入文件 |screed.tex|.
^^{input files}
\TeX\ 會作出如下顯示
% 4/23/90 is Shakespeare's 426th birthday, and Karl's 26th.
\csdisplay
This is TeX, Version 3.0 (preloaded format=plain 90.4.23)
**
|
在這裡, ``preloaded format'' (已預先載入的格式) 指的是 \TeX\ 提供的 ^{\plainTeX} 宏集的一個己預先產生的形式.
現在你可以輸入 `|screed|' 來讓 \TeX\ 來處理你的文件.
當處理結束時, 你可以在終端或者打印機印出的記錄上 (如果你不使用終端) 得到類似下面的輸出:
\csdisplay
(screed.tex [1] [2] [3] )
Output written on screed.dvi (3 pages, 400 bytes).
Transcript written on screed.log.
|
這個輸出大部分是不言自明的.
在括號中的數字是 \TeX\ 在把每頁內容輸入 \dvifile\ 時所顯示的當前頁碼.
當你提供的名件名不含擴展名時, \TeX\ 往往會把你的文件擴展名當作 `|.tex|'.
在某些 \TeX\ 環境中, 你可能可以直接執行類似下面的語句:
\csdisplay
tex screed
|
來直接處理文檔.

Instead of providing your \TeX\ input from a file, you can type it directly at
your terminal.  To do so, type `^|\relax|' instead of `|screed|' at the 
`|**|' prompt.
\TeX\ will now prompt you with a `|*|' for each line of input and interpret
each line of input as it sees it.
To terminate the input, type a command such as `|\bye|' that tells \TeX\
you're done.
Direct input is sometimes a handy way of experimenting with \TeX.

When your input file contains other embedded input files, the displayed
information indicates when \TeX\ begins and ends processing each 
embedded file.
^^{input files//embedded}
\xrdef{infiles}
\TeX\ displays a left parenthesis and the file name
when it starts working on a file and displays the corresponding right
parenthesis when it's done with the file. 
If you get any ^{error messages} in the displayed output, you can match
them with a file by looking for the most recent unclosed left parenthesis.

For a more complete explanation of how to run \TeX,
see \knuth{Chapter~6} and your ^{local information}.
\eix^^{running \TeX}


\section Preparing an input file

In this section we explain some of the conventions that you must follow in
preparing input for \TeX\null.  Some of the information given here also
appears in the examples in \chapterref{examples} of this book.
^^{input, preparing}

\subsection Commands and control sequences

\bix^^{commands}
\bix^^{control sequences}
Input to \TeX\ consists of a sequence of commands that tell \TeX\ how to
typeset your document.  Most characters act as commands of a particularly
simple kind: ``typeset me''.  The letter `|a|', for instance, is a
command to typeset an `a'.  But there's another kind of command---a
\emph{control sequence}---that gives \TeX\ a more elaborate
instruction.  A control sequence ordinarily starts with a backslash
(|\|), though you can change that convention if you need to.
\xrdef{@backslash}
For instance, the input:

\csdisplay
She plunged a dagger (\dag) into the villain's heart.
|
contains the control sequence |\dag|; it produces the typeset output:
\display{%
She plunged a dagger (\dag) into the villain's heart.
}
\noindent Everything in this example except for the |\dag| and the spaces
acts like a ``typeset me'' command.  We'll explain more about spaces
on \xrefpg{spaces}.

There are two kinds of control sequences: \emph{control words}
^^{control words}
and \emph{control symbols}:
^^{control symbols}
\ulist\compact
\li A control word consists of a
backslash followed by one or more letters, e.g., `|\dag|'.
The first character that isn't a letter marks the end
of the control word.
\li A control symbol consists of a backslash followed by a single character
that isn't a letter, e.g., `|\$|'.
The character can be a space or even the end of a line (which is a perfectly
legitimate character).
\endulist
\noindent
A control word (but not a control symbol)
absorbs any spaces or ends of line that follow it.
^^{control sequences//absorbing spaces}
If you don't want to lose a space after a control word,
follow the control sequence with a ^{control space}
(|\!visiblespace|) or with `|{}|'.  Thus either:
\csdisplay
The wonders of \TeX\!visiblespace!.shall never cease!!
|
or:\hfil\ 
\csdisplay
The wonders of \TeX{} shall never cease!!
|
produces:
\display{%
The wonders of \TeX{} shall never cease!
}
\noindent rather than:
\display{%
The wonders of \TeX shall never cease!
}
\noindent
which is what you'd get if you left out the `|\|\visiblespace'
or the `|{}|'.

Don't run a control word together with the text that follows it---\TeX\
won't know where the control word ends.  For instance, the |\c| control
sequence places a cedilla accent on the character that follows it.  The
French word {\it gar\c con\/} must be typed as
`|gar\c!visiblespace!.con|', not `|gar\ccon|'; if you write the latter,
\TeX\ will complain about an undefined control sequence |\ccon|.

A control symbol, on the other hand, doesn't absorb anything that
follows it.  Thus you must type `\$13.56' as `|\$13.56|', not
`|\$!vs13.56|'; the latter form would produce `\hbox{\$ 13.56}'.
However, those accenting commands that are named by control symbols are
defined in such a way that they produce the effect of absorbing a
following space.  Thus, for example, you can type the French word {\it
d\'eshabiller\/} either as `|d\'eshabiller|' or as
`|d\'!visiblespace!.eshabiller|'.

Every control sequence is also a command, 
but not the other way around.
^^{commands//versus control sequences}
^^{control sequences//versus commands}
For instance, the letter `|N|'
is a command, but it isn't a control sequence.
In this book we ordinarily use ``command'' rather than
``control sequence'' when either term would do.
We use ``control sequence'' when we want to emphasize aspects of \TeX\
syntax that don't apply to commands in general.

\eix^^{control sequences}
\eix^^{commands}


\subsection Arguments

\xrdef{arg1}
Some commands need to be followed by one or more
\emph{arguments} ^^{arguments}
that help to determine what the command does.
For instance, the |\vskip| command, which 
tells \TeX\ to skip down (or up) the page,
expects an argument specifying how much space to skip.  To skip
down two inches, you would type `|\vskip 2in|', where |2in|
is the argument of |\vskip|. 

Different commands expect different kinds of arguments.  Many commands
expect dimensions, such as the |2in| in the example above.
Some commands, particularly those defined by macros,
expect arguments that are either a single character or some
text enclosed in braces.
Yet others require that their arguments be enclosed in braces, i.e.,
they don't accept single-character arguments.
The description of each command in this book tells you what kinds of arguments,
if any, the command expects.
In some cases, required braces define a group (see \xref{bracegroup}).

\secondprinting{\vfill\eject}


\subsection Parameters

\xrdef{introparms}
Some commands are parameters (\xref{parameter}).
^^{parameters//as commands}
You can use a parameter in either of two ways:
\olist
\li You can use the value of a parameter 
as an argument to another command.  For example, the command
\hbox{|\vskip\parskip|}
causes a vertical skip by the value of the |\parskip| (paragraph skip)
glue parameter.
\li You can change the value of the parameter by assigning
something to it.  For example, the assignment \hbox{|\hbadness=200|}
causes the value of the |\hbadness| number parameter to be $200$.
\endolist
\noindent
We also use the term ``parameter'' to refer to entities such as |\pageno|
that are actually registers but behave just like parameters.
^^{registers//parameters as}

Some commands are names of tables.  These commands are used like
parameters, except that they require an additional argument that
specifies a particular entry in the table. For example, |\catcode| names
a table of category codes (\xref{category code}). Thus
the command
\hbox{|\catcode`~=13|} sets the category code of the `|~|'
character to $13$.


\subsection Spaces

\xrdef{spaces}
\bix^^{spaces}
You can freely use extra spaces in your input.  Under nearly all circumstances
\TeX\ treats several spaces in a row as being equivalent to a
single space.  For instance, it doesn't matter whether you put one space
or two spaces after a ^{period} in your input.  Whichever you do, \TeX\
performs its end-of-sentence maneuvers and leaves the appropriate
(in most cases) amount of space after the period.
\TeX\ also treats the end of an input line as equivalent to a space.
Thus you can end your input lines wherever it's convenient---%
\TeX\ makes input
lines into
paragraphs in the same way no matter where the line breaks are in your
input.

A blank line in your input marks the end of a paragraph.
^^{paragraphs//ending}
Several blank lines are equivalent to a single one.

\TeX\ ignores input spaces within math formulas (see below).  Thus you can
include or omit spaces anywhere within a math formula---\TeX\ doesn't care.
Even within a math formula, however,
you must not run a control word together with a following letter.

If you are defining your own macros, you need to be particularly careful about
where you put ends of line in their definitions.
It's all too easy to define a macro that produces an
^{unwanted space} in addition to whatever else it's supposed to produce.
We discuss this problem elsewhere since it's somewhat
technical; see \xrefpg{unwantedspace}.

A space or its equivalent between two words in your input doesn't simply turn
into a space character in your output.
A few of these input spaces turn into ends of lines
in the output,
since input lines generally don't correspond to output lines.
The others turn into spaces of variable width called ``glue'' (\xref{glue}),
which has a natural size (the size it ``wants to be'')
but can stretch or shrink.
When \TeX\ is typesetting a paragraph
that is supposed to have an even right margin (the usual
case), it adjusts the widths of the glue in each line
to get the lines to end at the margin.
(The last line of a paragraph is an exception, since it isn't ordinarily
required to end at the right margin.)

You can prevent an input space from turning into an end of line by using a
^{tie} (^|~|).
For example, you wouldn't want \TeX\ to put a line break between the
`Fig.' and `8' of `Fig.~8'.
By typing `|Fig.~8|' you can prevent such a line break.
\eix^^{spaces}
\needspace{2in}

\subsection Comments

\xrdef{comments}
\pix\bix^^{comments}
You can include comments in your \TeX\ input.
When \TeX\ sees a comment it just passes over it, so 
what's in a comment doesn't affect your typeset document in any way.
Comments are useful for
providing extra information about what's in your input file.
For example:
\csdisplay
% ========= Start of Section `Hedgehog' =========
|

{\indexchar % }%
A comment starts with a percent sign (|%|) and extends to the end of the
input line.
\TeX\ ignores not just the comment but the end of the line as well, so
comments have another very
important use: connecting two lines so that the end of line
^^{line breaks//deleting}
between them is invisible to \TeX\ and doesn't generate
an output space or an end of line.
For instance, if you type:
\csdisplay
A fool with a spread%
sheet is still a fool.
|
you'll get:
\display{
A fool with a spread%
sheet is still a fool.
}
\eix^^{comments}


\subsection Punctuation

\null
\xrdef{periodspacing}
\TeX\ normally adds some extra space after what it thinks is a
^{punctuation} mark at the end of a sentence,
namely, `^|.|', `^|?|', or `|!!|' \indexchar !
^^{period} ^^{question mark} ^^{exclamation point}
followed by an input space.
\TeX\ doesn't add
the extra space if the punctuation mark follows
a capital letter, though, because it assumes the capital
letter to be an initial in someone's name.
You can force the extra space where it wouldn't otherwise occur by
typing something like:
\csdisplay
A computer from IBM\null?
|
The |\null| doesn't produce any output, but it does prevent \TeX\
from associating the capital `M' with the question mark.
On the other hand, you can cancel the
extra space where it doesn't belong by typing a control space
after the punctuation mark, e.g.:
\csdisplay
Proc.\!visiblespace!.Royal Acad.\!visiblespace!.of Twits
|
so that you'll get:
\display{Proc.\ Royal Acad.\ of Twits}
\noindent rather than:
\display{Proc. Royal Acad. of Twits}

Some people prefer not to leave more space after punctuation at the
end of a sentence.  You can get this effect with the
^|\frenchspacing| command (\xref\frenchspacing).
|\frenchspacing| is often recommended for ^{bibliographies}.

For single ^{quotation marks}, you should use the left and right
single quotes
(|`| and |'|) on your keyboard.  For left and right
double quotation marks, use two left single
quotes or two right single quotes (|``| or |''|) rather
than the double quote (|"|) on your keyboard.
The keyboard double quote
will in fact give you a right double quotation mark in
many fonts, but the two right single quotes
are the preferred \TeX\ style.
For example:

\vbox{%
\csdisplay
There is no `q' in this sentence.
``Talk, child,'' said the Unicorn.
She said, ``\thinspace`Enough!!', he said.''
|
}%
These three lines yield:
\display{\par\restoreplainTeX
There is no `q' in this sentence.
\par ``Talk, child,'' said the Unicorn.
\par She said, ``\thinspace`Enough!', he said.''
}
\noindent
The |\thinspace| in the third input line prevents
the single quotation mark from coming
too close to the double quotation marks.
Without it, you'd just see three 
nearly equally spaced quotation marks in a row.

\TeX\ has three kinds of ^{dashes}:
\ulist\compact
\li Short ones (hyphens) like this ( - ). You get them by typing~`^|-|'.
\li Medium ones (en-dashes) like this ( -- ). You get them by typing~`^|--|'.
\li Long ones (em-dashes) like this ( --- ). You get them by typing~`^|---|'.
\endulist
\noindent
Typically you'd use hyphens to indicate compound words like
``will-o'-the-wisp'',
en-dashes to indicate
page ranges such as ``pages~81--87'', and em-dashes to indicate
a break in continuity---like this.


\subsection Special characters

Certain characters have special meaning to \TeX, so you shouldn't use them
in ordinary text.  They are:

\csdisplay
    $  #  &  %  _  ^  ~  {  }  \
|
^^|$//in ordinary text|
^^|#//in ordinary text|
^^|&//in ordinary text|
^^|_//in ordinary text|
^^|^//in ordinary text|
^^|~//in ordinary text|
^^|%//in ordinary text|
^^|{//in ordinary text|
^^|}//in ordinary text|
{\recat!ttidxref[\//in ordinary text]]
\noindent
In order to produce them in your typeset document,
you need to use circumlocutions.  For the first five,
you should instead type:
^^|\$|
^^|\#|
^^|\&|
^^|\%|
^^|\_|
\csdisplay
    \$  \#  \&  \%  \_
|

\noindent
For the others, you need something more elaborate:

\csdisplay
   \^{!visiblespace}   \~{!visiblespace}   $\{$   $\}$   $\backslash$
|


\subsection Groups

\bix^^{groups}
A \emph{group} 
consists of material enclosed in matching left and right braces (|{| and 
|}|).
^^|{//starting a group|
^^|}//ending a group|
By placing a command within a group, you can limit its effects to
the material within the group.  
For instance, the |\bf| command tells \TeX\ to set
something in {\bf boldface} type.  If you were to put |\bf| into your input
and do nothing else to counteract it, everything in your document following the
|\bf| would be set in boldface.
By enclosing |\bf| in a group,
you limit its effect to the group.  For example, if you type:
\csdisplay
We have {\bf a few boldface words} in this sentence.
|
\noindent you'll get:
\display{We have {\bf a few boldface words} in this sentence.}

\noindent You can also use a group to limit the effect of
an assignment to one of \TeX's parameters.
These parameters contain values that affect how \TeX\ typesets your document.
For example, the value of the |\parindent|
parameter specifies the indentation at the beginning of a paragraph.
The assignment |\parindent = 15pt|
sets the indentation to $15$ printer's points.
By placing this assignment at the beginning
of a group containing a few paragraphs, you can change
the indentation of just those paragraphs.  If you don't enclose
the assignment in a group,
the changed indentation will apply to the rest of the document (or up to the
next assignment to |\parindent|, if there's a later one).

\xrdef{bracegroup}
Not all pairs of braces indicate a group.
In particular, the braces associated with an argument for which the
braces are \emph{not} required don't indicate a group---they just
serve to delimit the argument.
Of those commands that do require braces for their arguments,
some treat the braces as defining a group
and the others interpret the argument in some special way that depends on
the command.\footnote
{More precisely, for primitive commands either
the braces define a group or they enclose tokens that aren't processed in
\TeX's stomach.
For |\halign| and |\valign| the group has a trivial
effect because everything within the braces either doesn't reach the stomach
(because it's in the template) or is enclosed in a further inner group.
^^|\halign//grouping for|
^^|\valign//grouping for|
}
\eix^^{groups}


\subsection Math formulas

\bix^^{math}
\xrdef{mathform}
A math formula can appear in text (\emph{text math})
^^{text math}
or set off on a line by itself
with extra vertical space around it (\emph{display math}).
^^{display math}
You enclose a text formula in single dollar signs (|$|)
and a displayed formula in double dollar signs (|$$|).
\ttidxref{$}\ttidxref{$$}
For example:

\csdisplay
If $a<b$, then the relation $$e^a < e^b$$ holds.
|
\noindent This input produces:
\display{\centereddisplays
If $a<b$, then the relation $$e^a < e^b$$ holds.}
\smallskip
\noindent \chapterref{math} describes the commands that are useful
in math formulas.
\eix^^{math}


\section How \TeX\ works

In order to use \TeX\ effectively, it helps to 
have some idea of how \TeX\ goes about
its activity of transmuting input into output.
You can imagine \TeX\ as a kind of organism with ``eyes'', 
``mouth'', ``gullet'',
``stomach'', and ``intestines''.
Each part of the organism transforms its input in some way and passes
the transformed input to the next stage.

The ^{eyes} transform an input file into a sequence of characters.
The ^{mouth} transforms the sequence of characters into a sequence of
\emph{tokens},
^^{tokens}
where each token is either a single character or a control sequence.
^^{control sequences//as tokens}
The gullet expands the tokens into a sequence of 
\emph{primitive commands}, which are also tokens.
^^{expanding tokens}
The ^{stomach} carries out the operations specified by the primitive commands,
producing a sequence of pages.
Finally, the ^{intestines} transform each page into the form required
for the \dvifile\ and send it there.
^^{\dvifile//created by \TeX's intestines}
These actions are described in more detail 
in \chapterref{concepts} under \conceptcit{\anatomy}.
^^{\anatomy}

The real typesetting goes on in the stomach.
The commands instruct \TeX\ to typeset such-and-such a character in
such-and-such a font, to insert an interword space, to end a paragraph, and
so on.
Starting with individual typeset characters and other simple typographic
elements, \TeX\ builds up a page ^^{pages} as a nest of
^{boxes} within boxes within boxes \seeconcept{box}.
Each typeset character occupies a box, and so does an entire page.
A box can contain not just smaller boxes but also \emph{glue} ^^{glue}
(\xref{glue}) and a few other things.
The glue produces
space between the smaller boxes.  
An important property of glue is that it can stretch and shrink;
thus \TeX\ can make a box
larger or smaller by stretching or shrinking
the glue within~it.

Roughly speaking, a line is a box containing a sequence of character boxes,
and a page is a box containing a sequence of line boxes.
There's glue between the words of a line and between the lines of a page.
\TeX\ stretches or shrinks
the glue on each line so as to make the right margin
of the page come out even and the glue on each page
so as to make the bottom margins of different pages be equal.
Other kinds of typographical elements can also appear in a line or in a page,
but we won't go into them here.

As part of the process of assembling pages, \TeX\ needs to break paragraphs
into lines and lines into pages.  The stomach first sees a paragraph as one
long line, in effect.  It inserts \emph{line breaks}
^^{line breaking}
in order to transform
the paragraph into a sequence of lines of the right length, performing a
rather elaborate analysis in order to choose the set of breaks
that makes the paragraph look best
\seeconcept{line break}.
The stomach carries out a similar
but simpler process in order to transform a sequence of lines into a page.
Essentially the stomach accumulates lines until no more lines can fit on the
page.  It then chooses a single place to break the page, putting the lines
before the break on the current page
and saving the lines after the break for the
next page \seeconcept{page break}. ^^{page breaks//inserted by \TeX's stomach}

When \TeX\ is assembling an entity from a list of items (boxes, glue, etc.),
it is in one of six
\emph{modes} ^^{modes} (\xref{mode}).
The kind of entity it is assembling defines the mode that it is in.  
There are two ordinary modes: ordinary horizontal mode for assembling
paragraphs (before they are broken into lines) 
and ordinary vertical mode for assembling pages.
There are two restricted modes:
restricted horizontal mode for appending items horizontally to form
a horizontal box
and internal vertical mode for appending items vertically to form
a vertical box (other than a page).
Finally, there are two math modes: text math mode for assembling math formulas
within a paragraph and display math mode for assembling math formulas that are
displayed on lines by themselves (see ``Math formulas'', \xref{mathform}).


\section 新 \TeX\ 和老 {\TeX}

我們建議你盡可能地使用新版本的 \TeX.

\section 資源

\xrdef{resources}
有很多資源可以幫助你使用 \TeX.
\texbook\ 是最可靠的 \TeX\ 信息來源.

\smallskip
{\narrower\noindent
^{Knuth, Donald E.}, \texbook.  Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1984.\par}
\smallskip
\noindent
請一定使用第十七次 (1990 年 1 月) 及以後的印刷版本.
早先的印刷版本不包括新 \TeX\ 的許多功能.

^{\LaTeX} 是一套為了簡化使用 \TeX\ 而設計的命令集
在這本書中有描述\footnote{譯者注: 這本書中介紹的 \LaTeX\ 己經過時}:
\smallskip
{\narrower\noindent\frenchspacing\spaceskip = 3.33pt plus 2pt minus 1.2pt
^{Lamport, Leslie}, {\sl The \LaTeX\ Document Preparation System}.
Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1986.\par}
\smallskip
\noindent
^{\AMSTeX} 是一套美國數學學會定義的提交電子數學手稿的命令標準,
在這裡有描述:
\smallskip
{\narrower\noindent
^{Spivak, Michael~D.}, {\sl The Joy of \TeX}. Providence, R.I.:
American Mathematical Society, 1986.
\par}
\smallskip
\noindent
你可以加入 ^{\TUG} (TUG), 這個組織出版一本名為 {\it ^{TUGBoad}} 的通訊.
TUG 是一個很好的信息來源渠道, 它同時也提供包括 \AMSTeX\ 在內的很多 \TeX\ 宏包資源, 
它的地址是:
\smallskip
{\obeylines
^{\TUG}
c/o American Mathematical Society
P.O. Box 9506
Providence,  RI  02940
U.S.A.
}
\smallskip
\noindent
最後, 你可以獲取在 \chapterref{eplain} 介紹的用來排版本書的宏包 ^|eplain.tex|.
它可以通過使用 \ftp\ 匿名登錄獲取:
{\obeylines\display{\tt
labrea.stanford.edu [36.8.0.47]
ics.uci.edu [128.195.1.1]
june.cs.washington.edu [128.95.1.4]}}

電子版本還包括了斯坦弗大學的 Oren Patashnik ^^{Patashnik, Oren} 為 ^{\BibTeX} 計算機程序處理輸入並且排印出其輸出的宏.
如果你在這個宏包中發現了錯誤, 或者想改進它, 你可以給 Karl 發電子郵件, Karl 的電子郵箱地址是 {\tt karl@cs.umb.edu}.

這個宏包可以通過向以下地址郵寄 10.00 美元購買 $5\frac1/4$\inches\
或 $3\frac1/2$\inches\  軟盘得到.
