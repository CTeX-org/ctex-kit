The absolute value of $X$, $|x|$, is defined by:
$$|x| = \cases{x, &if $x\ge 0$;\cr
-x,&otherwise.\cr}$$
Now for some numbered equations.
It is the case that for $k \ge 0$:
$$x^{k^2}=\overbrace{x\>x\>\cdots\> x}^{2k\ \rm times}
\eqno (1)$$

Here's an example that shows some spacing controls, with
a number on the left:
$$[u]!negthin[v][w]\,[x]\>[y]\;[z]\leqno(2a)$$
The amount of space between the items in brackets
gradually increases from left to right. (We've made
the space between the first two items be {\it less\/}
than the natural space.)
It is sometimes the case that $$\leqalignno{
u'_1 + tu''_2 &= u'_2 + tu''_1&(2b)\cr
\hat\imath &\ne \hat \jmath&(2c)\cr
\vec {\vphantom{b}a}&\approx \vec b\cr}$$
% The \vphantom is an invisible rule as tall as a `b'.
The result is of order $O(n \log\log n)$. Thus
$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n
= {\rm Sum}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n). \eqno(3)$$
and
$$dx\,dy = r\,dr\,d\theta!negthin.\eqno(4)$$
The set of all $q$ such that $q\le0$ is written as:
$$\{\,q\mid q\le0\, \}$$
Thus
$$\forall x\exists y\;P(x,y)\Rightarrow
\exists x\exists y\;P(x,y)$$
where
$$P(x,y) \buildrel \rm def \over \equiv
\hbox{\rm any predicate in $x$ and $y$} . $$
