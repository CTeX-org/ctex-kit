Chinese Font Metrics is a set of font metrics for using Chinese fonts under the latex->dvipdfmx or pdflatex route. Note, latex->dvips is not supported since dvips can not embed ttf. In order to use that in dvips, you should create type1 subfonts from truetype files by your self (perhaps using ttf2pt1 or fontforge).

No actual Chinese TrueType typeface font is provided in the package. If you want to use this package, bear in mind that a set of ttfs (like sim*.ttf distributed in Simplified Chinese version of Windows XP) are needed for font embedding. Just copy the sim*.ttf to corresponding directory enables you to typeset Chinese out of the box. If you are using other fonts, you might consider adding/modifying the map lines manually.

the package contained three directory:
- fonts/tfm: contained all the tfm metric files for 6 typeface (kai, song, lishu, fangsong, youyuan, hei) in two widely used character encodings (GBK and UTF-8) here. 
- scripts: in order to make sure that all the above tfms distributed have no legal problems (since most Chinese TrueType fonts are commercial, and converting that using ttf2tfm might raise some legal problems) Lingyun Wu wrote a script to generate the metrics. Lua and pltotf are used to generate the tfms, no actual ttf are involved thanks to the fact that Chinese characters are monospace font by nature. 
- fonts/map and tex/latex/zhwinfonts: default map file (for simsun.ttf, simhei.ttf, simfang.ttf, simkai,ttf, simli.ttf and simyou.ttf. These fonts are widely used in China) for pdftex, ttf2pk and dvipdfmx.

The package is created following Yue Wang's article. If you are interested in why this package can do the magic, that article explains everything, available on http://bbs.ctex.org/viewthread.php?tid=50078.
